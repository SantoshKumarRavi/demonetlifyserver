# Help for Career Foundry Students converting their Heroku app to Netlify

Hi, my name is Ted and I made this repo to help with CF students who are no longer able to post their movie apis to Heroku and would like to move them to Netlify.

Just one thing:  Netlify is not your only option.  So this repo is only for those who choose this particular one.

I used [this](https://github.com/neverendingqs/netlify-express/blob/master/server-local.js) repo and [this](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/13/how-to-run-express.js-apps-with-netlify-functions/) article as my guide to create this.

If you have any questions about applying this, please make an appointment with your mentor.
